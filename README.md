Market Neutral Strategy

This project focuses on implementing a market-neutral strategy to generate consistent returns, regardless of overall market direction. By simultaneously taking long and short positions in securities, the strategy 
aims to profit from relative price movements between assets while minimizing market risk. The project will involve identifying mispriced securities, constructing a diversified portfolio, and employing rigorous risk 
management techniques to achieve optimal performance.
